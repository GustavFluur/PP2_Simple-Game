 # Rock, Scissor and Paper
The website is constructed and well-handled to use with its simple approach. You can play this game on all devices, and it makes it entertaining due to its high accessibility. The game is directed only to single players because you have only one opponent. 

Rock, Scissor, and Paper page is using emojis of items and has the appearance of a website that you saw during the 1990s by the usage of simple visual effects and comprehendible selections with random results.

Likewise, it’s challenging in the way that you are facing the computer as an opponent and your choices are being well observed for the user to understand what button was selected in the latest action.

The game is targeted towards people of all ages and seeks to be entertaining in all environments. Where the user can connect to each other by joining together to get as many points as possible where for later build a new community.

# Features

## Existing Features
Once you are entering the website you will face a short introduction to what the page is about and as soon as you are interacting with the selections, you'll start the game right away. 

The Rock, Scissor, and Paper page consist of only one page with an unchallenging HTML structure and visual effects by each selecting item thanks to the CSS. 

## Header

## The Game Option

- The game is operating in a way where the game participator is picking one of three options. How do you have selected one of them the item is increasing its size. This makes it clear on what you choose to later take on the next move against the opponent. (I have added a circle into where the user is choosing the scissor.  For comparing the changes and to distinguish the visual effects of what’s being ‘active’ or not)

## Gaming Result

- You will be witnessing the results below of the page, where it indicates either your winning - or losing score. The user is will able to tell how everything is going in the process of the game but have the opportunity to observe progress directly receive the information along with the game participation.  

- In the resulting feature the game is demonstrating a sense of randomly set up and in that regard it makes it challenging for the user without no knowing the opponent's or computer's decision-making. You don't know what you will get by selecting a specific item thus getting results according to your action.
