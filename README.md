 # Rock, Scissor and Paper
The website is constructed and well-handled to use for all ages within its simple approach. Rock, Scissor, and Paper page is using emojis instead of pictures and has the appearance of a website that you saw during the 1990s by the usage of simple visual effects and comprehendible selections. Likewise, itâ€™s challenging in the way that you are facing the computer as an opponent and your choices are being well observed for the user to understand what button was selected in the latest action.

The website got the inspiration and got the structure from the [Love Maths](https://8000-gustavfluur-lovemaths-c9f3u8arlvx.ws-eu38.gitpod.io/), and the youtube channel: **How To Code Rock Paper Scissors In JavaScript by Web Dev Simplified** [Learning Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yS-JV4fWqY).

Sites that gave me the support for the website were: 
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/),
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).
