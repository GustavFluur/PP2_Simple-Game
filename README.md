 # Rock, Scissor and Paper
The website is constructed and well-handled to use for all ages within its simple approach. Rock, Scissor, and Paper page is using emojis instead of pictures and has the appearance of a website that you saw during the 1990s by the usage of simple visual effects and comprehendible selections. Likewise, itâ€™s challenging in the way that you are facing the computer as an opponent and your choices are being well observed for the user to understand what button was selected in the latest action.

The Rock, Scissor and Paper page consist of only one page with a unchallenging HTML structure and visual effects by each selecting item thanks to the CSS. 

- E.g. where either the rock or paper is increasing in size by highlighting your choice, thus creates a understanding on what you have picked against your opponent. 
- You will be witnessing the results below, where it indicates either your winning - or losing score. Everything is randomly constructed and in that regard makes the game challenging for the user without no knowing the oppont's or computer's decision-making.
