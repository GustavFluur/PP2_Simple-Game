## Content 
The website got the inspiration and got the structure from the [Love Maths](https://8000-gustavfluur-lovemaths-c9f3u8arlvx.ws-eu38.gitpod.io/), and the youtube channel: **How To Code Rock Paper Scissors In JavaScript by Web Dev Simplified** [Learning Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yS-JV4fWqY).

Sites that gave me the support for the website were: 
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).
